This project implements a Machine Learning model to predict the price of gold based on historical data. The model can be used to analyze trends and make predictions for future gold prices.

The project demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and building a regression model using Python and scikit-learn.

Features

Predicts gold prices using historical data.

Visualizes trends in gold prices using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Handles missing values and data preprocessing automatically.

Supports evaluation using RÂ² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Dataset

The dataset contains historical gold prices along with relevant features such as:

Date

Gold Price (Target)

Economic indicators (if used)

Data is stored in CSV format: gold_price_data.csv.
